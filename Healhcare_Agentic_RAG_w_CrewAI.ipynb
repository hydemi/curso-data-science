The chi-square test for blood type and t-test for age will help determine the statistical significance of the observations. If you need the exact p-values, running the provided Python code with the actual dataset is necessary.\n\nThis comprehensive analysis provides the necessary insights for the Senior Epidemiologists to further investigate the correlations and patterns in the dataset."
